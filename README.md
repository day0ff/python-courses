# 🐍 Python Homework Course

This repository is designed for students to **practice Python programming** and **self-check their homework** using automatic tests.

---

## 📚 Course Structure
- `tasks/` → Python files with assignments. Each file contains an unfinished function with `TODO` instructions;
- `poetry.lock` → File ensures reproducible installs;
- `pyproject.toml` → Is a configuration file used by packaging tools(like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)).
---

## ⚙️ Dependencies

To work with this repository, you need:

- **Python 3.8+** → The programming language.  
    Check your version:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```


- pip → Python package manager (comes with Python).
    Check if installed:

    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the Repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/day0ff/python-courses.git
    cd python-courses
    ```

2. Install Dependencies

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. Do the Homework
Open the file in tasks/chapter_01_variables/, for example task01.py:

    ```python
    # tasks/chapter_01_variables/task01.py

    name = 'Alice'
    age = 21
    is_student = True

    ```

4. Run Tests
To check your solution: write pytest and a pass to you solution file tests/test_task01_ifelse.py

    ```bash
    poetry run pytest tasks/chapter_01_variables/test_task01.py
    ```

    __OR__ shorter

    ```bash
    pytest tasks/chapter_01_variables/test_task01.py
    ```

    Where:
    - `tasks/` → folder of all homework tasks;
    - `chapter_01_variables/` → the folder of the current exercise topic being performed;
    - `test_task01.py` → a test file for checking the current exercise.

    You should see output like:

    ```bash
    ===================== test session starts =====================
    collected 5 items

    tasks/chapter_01_variables/test_task01.py .....                        [100%]

    ====================== 5 passed in 0.01s ======================
    ```

✅ All tests passed = task completed successfully!


## ▶️ Running Tests

You can run tests in different ways depending on what you want to check:

1. Run all tests in the repository

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

2. Run all tests in a specific folder

    For example, run all tests in the tests/ folder:

    ```bash
    pytest tasks/chapter_01_variables/
    ```

3. Run a single test file

    For example, only test the first homework task:

    ```bash
    pytest tasks/chapter_01_variables/test_task01.py
    ```

4. Run a single test function inside a file

    For example, only run the test_positive function:

    ```bash
    pytest tasks/chapter_01_variables/test_task01.py::test_name_is_string
    ```

## ❓ About __init__.py Files

tasks/ and all subfolder for example chapter_01_variables/ contain an __init__.py file.
These files are needed so that Python treats the folders as packages, which allows imports like:

```# tasks/__init__.py
from tasks.chapter_01_variables import task01
```

The __init__.py file can be empty — this is enough to mark the folder as a package.

Optionally, you can add imports or variables inside it. For example:

```# tasks/__init__.py
from .chapter_01_variables import name
```

Now you could simply do:

``` #tasks/__init__.py
from tasks import name
```

For this course, the __init__.py files are kept empty.

## 📝 Example Task

Task 01: Assign variables in Python.

write

name = 'Alice'
age = 21
is_student = True

Check your solution:

pytest tasks/chapter_01_variables/test_task01.py

## 📌 Notes

Always write code inside the function body (don’t change function names).

If all tests pass → your solution is correct! 🎉

If some tests fail → read the error message and fix your code.

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

pytest → testing framework (already included).

VS Code or PyCharm → for writing Python code.
