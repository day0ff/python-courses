Task 03: Determine the grade based on a score.

Write a function `get_grade(score: int) -> str` that:
- Assume score is between 0 and 100 inclusive
- Returns "A" if score is 90 or above
- Returns "B" if score is 80-89
- Returns "C" if score is 70-79
- Returns "D" if score is 60-69
- The "F" case(if score is below 60), should be implemented later.

Hint
Use Pythone Pass Statement when score is below 60.
